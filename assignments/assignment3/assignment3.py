# Assignment 3 - Face Recognition using Eigenfaces

In this assigment we will implement and apply PCA to a dataset of celebrity faces, before finally building a very simple face classifier. To do this, we are going to: preprocess our images, implement PCA, and finally visualize the results of applying it to our dataset.

Complete the sections of the assignment prefixed with **"TODO"**:

* [2. PCA](#scrollTo=EHMIljnpdaBE)
* [3.1 Eigenfaces](#scrollTo=A_JqQwEmu7ef)
* [3.2 Eigenfaces](#scrollTo=YTdZF-O6daaK)
* [4.2 Face Classification](#scrollTo=IDhubLwVh2Vr)

## 1) Preparing the Dataset

First, we need to download the dataset and preprocess the data. To accomplish this, we will load the images into a (N, H, W) NumPy matrix (where N is the number of images, and H, W are the image dimensions). Furthermore, we will also need to center crop the images to remove the background and only keep the face in the images. As an aside, it is also reccomended to make sure the images in our dataset are aligned (e.g., eyes, nose, etc.); the dataset we will be using has already done this for us.

**Bonus:** If you have a few pictures of your friends, you can also supplement the dataset using their photos! Later on we will be building a face recognition system for which you use these photos to test.

### 1.1) First, download the dataset and extract the images

# Download the dataset (subset of CelebA).
!wget -O a3_face_dataset.tar.gz https://www.dropbox.com/s/4nmsiafyvw0o5fx/a3_face_dataset.tar.gz?dl=0

# Extract the contents of the compressed file.
!tar xzf a3_face_dataset.tar.gz
!ls

"""### 1.2) Preview a few images from the dataset"""

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from IPython.display import display, Image

# Display the first images from the dataset. You can also browse these by
# navigating through the notebooks file system!
sample_images = glob.glob('a3_face_dataset/*.jpg')[:5]
for file_path in sample_images:
  display(Image(file_path))

"""### 1.3) Load the dataset and convert into a NumPy matrix"""

import cv2
import numpy as np

# Load images in greyscale.
image_paths = list(glob.glob('a3_face_dataset/*.jpg'))
images = np.stack([cv2.imread(str(x), cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE) 
                   for x in image_paths])
print('Original Image Shape (N, H, W):', images.shape)

"""###1.4) Center crop the images and visualize the results"""

import PIL

# Helper function for cropping the center of the image to remove the background
# and only keep the face.

    h, w = img.shape
    center_y, center_x = h // 2, w // 2
    offset_y, offset_x = center_y // 2, center_x // 2
    return img[center_y - offset_y: center_y + offset_y,
               center_x - offset_x: center_x + offset_x]
  
# Center crop our images.
images = np.stack([center_crop(img) for img in images])
img_height, img_width = images.shape[1:3]
print('Cropped Image Shape (N, H, W):', images.shape)

# Visualize a few results.
for i in range(5):
  display(PIL.Image.fromarray(images[i]))

"""###1.5) Lastly, flatten each image into a single vector"""

# Flatten the images into a (N, HxW) sized array, where N is the number of 
# images and H, W are the dimensions of the image.
num_images = len(images)
images = images.reshape(num_images, -1)
print('Matrix Shape (N, H*W):', images.shape)

"""## 2) PCA Implementation

For this assignment we will be implementing PCA using only linear algebra libraries. As a guideline, we will loosely follow the interface of the scikit-learn version of PCA. As an added challenge, you are encouraged to implement PCA in a **computationally efficient manner** (i.e., without computing the entirety of the covariance matrix explicitly, as this matrix can be extremely large).

**Please refer to the class notes, and the following resources as a guideline for implementing PCA. Keep in mind that notation may vary between resources; furthermore, make sure that your matrices are arranged in the correct order (e.g., you may need to tranpose your matrix):**

"""## 4) Face Recognition

In this section, we're going to build a simple face recognition system using eigenfaces. To accomplish this, we're going
to take a test image and project it onto our principal components learned from our training set of celebrity faces. Finally, we will compare
the resulting vector to all of the other faces in the training set and find the closest match (i.e., 1-nearest-neighbour classification).

For instance, this training set has photos of Obama -- in theory then, if we were to test another photo of Obama (not in the training set, cropped and aligned), we should find that the closest match in the training set will also be a photo of Obama.
