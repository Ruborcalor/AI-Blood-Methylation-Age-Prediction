# Assignment 2 ― Classification

## 0. Introduction

In this second assigment, we will explore another cornerstone of machine learning: supervised classification. We will be specifically classifying movie reviews by their corresponding score. To do this, we will first pre-process the raw data by cleaning and turning each review into a vector. Then, we will explore the following learning algorithms for classification: support vector classifiers, random forests, and naive Bayes classifiers.

## 1. Importing Libraries and Data

For this assignment, we will be using a dataset of metatritic reviews. The data consists of a csv file where the first column is a string containing a user review and the second column contains the corresponding score that the user gave to the movie. First, we will import any libraries that we might use.

**Note.** You may use any library you'd like unless when otherwise specified to not use any or to use a particular one.

### Question 1.1 Importing Libraries

Add any modules you use as you complete the assignment here.

We now need to turn each review into vectors. We will pick the top 10,000 words as features

Using those 10,000 features, create a function called `vectorize` which will take a string as an input, and convert it to a vector using the binary bag of words representation.

For example, the string `"This movie made me cry"` will become a vector of size 10,000 with 5 elements being 1 (assuming each word is part of the 10,000 most common) and 9995 being 0, that it, is i will look something like

 In order to accomplish this task, you will
 
 1. write a `get_vocab` function which takes as an argument a list of (cleaned) reviews and the vocabulary size and outputs the a list of size `vocab_size` containing the most common words.
 2. write a `vectorize` function which takes as an argument a review and the vocabulary and turns the review into its binary bag of words representation.
 3. use the `vectorize` function to create a new variable called `vectorized_data` which will contain the bag-of-words representation of each data point contained in the `clean_data` variable rather than its string representation. Don't forget that a data point consists of review-score pairs.

**Warning**: this may take up to five minutes depending on implementation. Make use of dictionaries if you want this to be faster. However, speed is not evaluated.

"""### Question 2.4 Cleaning, Again

You may have noticed that some of the reviews are not in English. If we keep them in the dataset, this may cause accuracy to decrease. This is due to the fact that many of them will contain no words from our vocabulary, and will all have a zero-vector bag-of-words representation. However, there may be non-English language reviews that contain at least one word which is spelled the same as an English word. So, a better heuristic to determine if a review is in English or not is to check if it has at least 5 words from our vocabulary.

To that end, create a variable called `english_data`, which contains only the bag-of-words representations of english reviews by keeping only those which have at least 5 non-zero entries.

To that end, first create a copy of the variable `english_data`, which will be called `shuffled_data`, and then shuffle it so that it consists of a random reordering of the rows in `english_data`.

"""##6. Naive Bayes
Until now, we've used pre-existing implementations of two types of classifiers: random forests and support vector machines. Now, we will cover a third type of classifier: naive Bayes classifers. However, this time we will be writing it from scratch.

Naive Bayes classifiers are part of a larger family of classifiers which are so called 'probabilistic classifiers'. This is because they do not only try to predict classes given features, but they estimate probabilities distributions over a set of classes.

First, we will go over some definitions.

**Definition.** A *prior probability* is the likelihood of an event given no further assumptions. For instance, the probability that it's raining is relatively low.

**Definiton.** A *posterior probability* or *conditional probability* is the likelihood of an event given that some other event has occurred. For instance, the probability that it's raining given that there are clouds is higher than if we don't make that assumption.

Now we will go over some motivation.

For the purpose of argument, imagine we had access to the probability distribution $\Pr$. That is, we know how likely features and classes are. For example, $\Pr(x_1 = 1)$ is the probability that the most common word, i.e. "the", is in a random movie review. Presumably, this probability is relatively high. As a second example, $\Pr(y = 1)$ is the probability that a random movie review is 'good'. In our case, this would be somewhere close to 0.67.

Since we hypothetically have access to the whole probability distribution, we also know conditional probabilities. For instance, we would know $\Pr(y = 0 \; \vert \; x_1 = 0)$, which is the probability that a random review is 'bad', given that it does not contain the word "the".

Given a probability distribution, we can find an optimal classifier which simply picks the class which maximizes the probability that we will see that class given the observed features, in other words our classifier $f: \B^n \to \B$ is given by:

$$ f(x_1, \ldots, x_n) = \argmax_{c \in \B} \Pr(y = c \given x_1, \ldots, x_n ).$$

Where $\argmax$ returns the element in $\B$ which maximizes the expression to its right, and $\B$ is the set with two elements, $\{0, 1\}$. For example, we have
$$ \argmax_{x \in \R} (x - x^2) = \frac 1 2, $$
since $\frac 1 2$ maximizes the expression $x - x^2$.

It would be great if we had access to the probability distribution $\Pr$, but unfortunately we don't in almost every case. This means we wish to try to estimate it given some samples, i.e. the training data.

However, we run into another issue: estimating the probability distribution is computionally expensive. Therefore, we assume that the different features are independent from one another. This is called the *naive conditional independence assumption*. In other words, we assume that

$$ \forall i \in \{1, \ldots, n\} : \Pr (x_i \given y, x_1, \ldots, x_{i-1}, x_{i+1}, \ldots, x_n) = \Pr(x_i \given y).$$

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can simplify the conditional independence assumption to:

$$\Pr(y \given x_1, \ldots, x_n) = \frac{\Pr(y) \prod_{i=1}^n \Pr(x_i \given y)}{\Pr(x_1, \ldots, x_n)}.$$

However, we can observe that the denominator is constant for a given input, so it's not actually necesarry to estimate it if all we want is to find the class with the maximum posterior probability. In other words,

$$ \Pr(y \given x_1, \ldots, x_n) \propto \Pr(y) \prod_{i=1}^n \Pr(x_i \given y), $$

so, our classification rule becomes

$$ f(x_1, \ldots, x_n) = \argmax_{y \in \B} \Pr(y) \prod _{i=1}^n \Pr(x_i \given y).$$

Where $\propto$ means "proportional to" and  $\prod_{i = 1}^n g(i)$ is like summation $\left(\sum_{i=1}^n g(i)\right)$, except that addition is replaced with multiplication. For example,

$$\prod_{i = 1}^5 i^2 = 1^2 \cdot 2^2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 4^2 \cdot 5^2.$$

**Note**: To estimate prior and conditional probabilities, we use the ratios of occurence counts found in the dataset. For example, to estimate $\Pr(x_1 = 0 \; \vert \; y = 0)$, we have to calculate the number of instances of class zero for which $x_1 = 0$ and divide them by the number of instances of class 0.

**Note**: The naive independence assumption is usually false in practice for most features. Therefore, the resulting estimated probability distribution is usually a bad approximation of the true distribution. However, the resulting classifier often has a good performance, depending on the dataset.

### Quesiton 6.1 Estimating the Probability Distribution

It would be expensive to re-estimate prior and posterior probabilities every time, so we should save probabilities in memory.

Thus, you will need to save
1. $\Pr(y)$ for each $y \in \B$, and
2. $\Pr(x_i = u \; \vert \; y)$ for each $ i \in \{1, \ldots, n\}$, $u \in \mathbb{B}$ and $y \in \mathbb{B}$.

Remember that you are *estimating* the probabilities using the training set only.
