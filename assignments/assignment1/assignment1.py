# MAIS 202 Fall 2019 - Assignment 1

Welcome to the MAIS 202 ML bootcamp! Get ready for an amazing 9 weeks, where you'll learn ML fundamentals, make new friends, and become a better developer.

In this first assignment, we will be implementing the first concept taught in every ML class: linear regression. Specifically, we will be solidifying your knowledge of linear regression, gradient descent, train-val-test split, overfitting/underfitting, and L2 regularization. While you will likely never have to implement your own linear regression algorithm from scratch in practice, doing so will help you better understand the underlying mathematics behind the concepts.

"""## 1) Read in the data

We're given three csv's for this assignment, `Dataset_1_train.csv`, `Dataset_1_valid.csv`, and `Dataset_1_test.csv`, which will be our training, validation, and test sets respectively. As mentioned in lectures, it's important to train our model on only a portion of the data available (the training set). Testing our model on data it has never seen gives us a better measure of the model's accuracy and tells us whether or not the model has overfit/underfit.

The validation set is used during model development to 1) check the performance, bias (underfitting), and variance (overfitting) of the model, and 2) to tune hyperparameters. (We will be using the validation set for hyperparameter tuning later in the assignment.) Even though the model never trains on the validation set, our hyperparmaeters may still be tweaked in favour of validation set performance. As a result, we need the test set, which is only used at the very end of the ML pipeline, to measure the model's accuracy on truly unseen data.

"""## 2) Linear Regression

**This is a reminder that for this assignment, while you may use general utility libraries like numpy and pandas (specifically their matrix computations and data manipulations), pre-existing implementations of the model is prohibited.**

### Q1: linear regression via closed-form ordinary least square solution

Now we will implement polynomial regression for a 15-degree polynomial. As we saw in lectures, linear regression aims to find a solution to the equation:

$$Y(X) = W^T \cdot \phi(X)$$

where

$$\phi(X) = \left[  1 ,  X ,  X^2 ,  X^3 , \ldots, X^n \right ]$$

The model does this by "tweaking" (aka training) W to maximize the probability function:

$$p\left(y \;\middle|\; W^{\operatorname T} x\right)$$
 
The closed-form ordinary least square solution to this problem (found by setting the gradient to 0) is:

$$W = \left(X^{\operatorname T} X\right)^{-1}X^{\operatorname T}Y$$

Now that we have the building blocks for linear regression, we can code it.

*Note: Make sure to review the slides, do some research, and/or ask for clarification if this doesn't make sense. You must understand the underlying math before being able to implement this properly.*

### Q2: linear regression via gradient descent

We will now implement the same polynomial regression from above, but using gradient descent! In ML, we can't always optimize our cost functions with a closed form solution like in question 1 (it's often too computationally expensive). Thankfully, optimization algorithms, one of which is gradient descent, can help us approximate the minimum of the cost function.

Recall that the cost function for linear regression is:

$$ J(W) = \frac{1}{2m}\cdot\sum_{i=0}^{m} \left(W^{\operatorname T}x^{(i)} - y^{(i)}\right)^2 $$

Where _i_ represents the sample number out of a total of *m* samples. Notice that the second factor is the sum of the squared errors. The $\frac{1}{m}$ is to calculate the mean of the squared errors, and the $\frac{1}{2}$ is to make the gradient nicer.

When we take the partial derivative of J(W) with respect to weight $W_j$, the jth parameter of vector _W_, we get:

$$ \frac{dJ}{dw_j} = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=0}^{m} \left (W^{\operatorname T}x^{(i)} - y^{(i)} \right ) \cdot x_j^{(i)} $$

Where $x_j^{(i)}$ is the jth parameter of the vector $x^{(i)}$.

The following is the gradient descent algorithm for linear regression:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for $w_j$ in W:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<t>$ \displaystyle w_j := w_j - \alpha \cdot \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=0}^{m} \left (W^Tx^{(i)} - y^{(i)} \right ) \cdot x_j^{(i)}$
    
We can run the gradient descent update for as many itertions as needed until the amount the gradients change each loop is negligible (less than a given _epsilon_).

"""As you can see again, the MSE of the validation set is much higher than that of the training set; in other words, our model doesn't perform that well on the validation set. You may have also noticed that the results from gradient descent do not perfectly match the results from calculating _W_ using the closed-form solution. Given our low number of data points, in this case finding the minimum of the cost function with gradient descent takes longer than using the approach from Q1. (If you want to get the exact results, just run the training cell again and keep iterating--but it might take a while.)

### Q3: Using your knowledge from the lectures, explain whether the model is overfitting or underfitting the training data and a potential reason why.

The model is overfitting the training data. I can tell because the MSE of the training data is far lower than the MSE of the validation data.

This is likely because the degree of polynomial we are using in the model is much greater than that which is best suited for this dataset. The high degree of polynomial allows the model to fit the training data very well, but also means that it isn't as generalizable to the dataset as a whole.

## 3) Regularization

### Q4: regularized linear regression via gradient descent

One way to address overfitting is to add regularization. In this part of the assignment, we will be adding *L2 regularization* to gradient descent.

Recall that with regularization, the Residual Sum of Squares equation becomes:

$$ RSS(W) =  \sum_{i=0}^{m} \left (W^{\operatorname T}x^{(i)} - y^{(i)} \right )^2 + \lambda \cdot \sum_{j=1}^{p} w_j^2 $$

Where _i_ represents the sample number out of a total of *m* samples and $w_j$ represents the jth parameter of W out of _p_ parameters. The reason j starts at 1 is because we normally don't regularize the bias term $w_0$.

Making these same changes to our cost function from Q2, we have:

$$ J(W) = \frac{1}{2m}\left[\sum_{i=0}^{m} \left (W^{\operatorname T}x^{(i)} - y^{(i)} \right )^2 + \lambda \cdot \sum_{j=1}^{p} w_j^2\right] $$

Once again, $\frac{1}{m}$ is to calculate the mean of the squared errors, and the $\frac{1}{2}$ is to make the gradient nicer.

Now, when we take the partial derivative of J(W) with respect to weight $w_j$, the jth parameter of vector _W_, we get a different result for $w_0$ than for the rest of the parameters:

$$ \frac{dJ}{dw_0} = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m} \left (W^{\operatorname T}x^{(i)} - y^{(i)}\right) \cdot x_j^{(i)} $$

$$ \frac{dJ}{dw_j} = \frac{1}{m}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{m} \left(W^{\operatorname T}x^{(i)} - y^{(i)}\right) \cdot x_j^{(i)}\right) + \frac{\lambda}{m} \cdot w_j  \quad \text{for}\ j = 1, 2, \ldots, p $$

Putting this all together into the gradient descent algorithm for regularized linear regression gives us:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for $w_j$ in W:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<t>if j = 0<br>

We choose to use a validation set instead of our test set because we need completely new test set data to obtain a truly fair performance metric at the end.

"""### Q5: What do you think is the degree of the source polynomial? What evidence in the previous cells indicate that regularization addressed the issues (overfitting/underfitting) mentioned in Q3? Explain your answer.

It appears as though the source polynomial is of degree three based on the single inflection point.

It appears as though the regularization has addressed overfitting mentioned in Q3 based on the far lower regularized validation set MSE, and the way that the regularized training MSE is closer to the regularized validation MSE. Note that the regularized training set MSE is actually greater that the unregularized training set MSE. This makes sense from the point of view of eliminating overfitting. The greater MSE on the regularized training set data appears because, while the models goal is to minimize MSE, it does so only to the extent that it is still viable on other parts of the dataset.
